> *verb* – sharing an Internet connection from one device to another

Since Android 4.1.2 mobile data traffic through "tethering" is marked in a way that enables phone companies to charge extra when using it; thanks to this app you can free your device from such unjust restriction!

Why:
---

This project was created mainly for 3 reasons:

1. I couldn't find an app that applied such "fix" automatically at boot

2. I liked the challenge of building an interesting UI/UX for something as simple as running a single root command

3. I wanted to experiment with a few things, starting from the shining new Google Now / Kitkat style
